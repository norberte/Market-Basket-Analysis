# Main tasks
  1. Analyze the data, show us what you did/would do and explain us how to interpret results. You are free to use any tools you like.
  2. Describe a model you would choose to provide a website personalization solution. Define your own (imaginary) goal for this personalization.  How would you adjust the model/analysis if used regularly.
  3. Describe at least one way of how to deploy your solution in terms of software architechture. You can make assumptions on how you would receive this data and show us a pipeline. (If you have some prior knowledge consider GCP as an environment.)
